**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.
6. The Group operates in one segment i.e. Information Technology services. Accordingly, no separate segment disclosures as required under "Ind AS-108: Operating Segments" have been presented.
7. "The Government of India has consolidated 29 existing labour legislations into a united framework comprising four Labour Codes viz Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (collectively referred to as 'the New Labour Codes'). The New Labour Codes have been made effective from 21 November 2025. The Ministry of Labour & Employment published draft Central Rules and FAOs to enable assessment of the financial impact due to changes in regulations. Basis the Group's assessment, there is no material impact on the consolidated financial results for the quarter/period ended 31 December 2025. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central/State rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the New Labour Codes and would provide appropriate accounting effect on the basis of such developments as needed."

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.
6. The Group operates in one segment i.e. Information Technology services. Accordingly, no separate segment disclosures as required under "Ind AS-108: Operating Segments" have been presented.
7. "The Government of India has consolidated 29 existing labour legislations into a united framework comprising four Labour Codes viz Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (collectively referred to as 'the New Labour Codes'). The New Labour Codes have been made effective from 21 November 2025. The Ministry of Labour & Employment published draft Central Rules and FAOs to enable assessment of the financial impact due to changes in regulations. Basis the Group's assessment, there is no material impact on the consolidated financial results for the quarter/period ended 31 December 2025. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central/State rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the New Labour Codes and would provide appropriate accounting effect on the basis of such developments as needed."

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.
6. The Group operates in one segment i.e. Information Technology services. Accordingly, no separate segment disclosures as required under "Ind AS-108: Operating Segments" have been presented.
7. "The Government of India has consolidated 29 existing labour legislations into a united framework comprising four Labour Codes viz Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (collectively referred to as 'the New Labour Codes'). The New Labour Codes have been made effective from 21 November 2025. The Ministry of Labour & Employment published draft Central Rules and FAOs to enable assessment of the financial impact due to changes in regulations. Basis the Group's assessment, there is no material impact on the consolidated financial results for the quarter/period ended 31 December 2025. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central/State rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the New Labour Codes and would provide appropriate accounting effect on the basis of such developments as needed."

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.
6. The Group operates in one segment i.e. Information Technology services. Accordingly, no separate segment disclosures as required under "Ind AS-108: Operating Segments" have been presented.
7. "The Government of India has consolidated 29 existing labour legislations into a united framework comprising four Labour Codes viz Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (collectively referred to as 'the New Labour Codes'). The New Labour Codes have been made effective from 21 November 2025. The Ministry of Labour & Employment published draft Central Rules and FAOs to enable assessment of the financial impact due to changes in regulations. Basis the Group's assessment, there is no material impact on the consolidated financial results for the quarter/period ended 31 December 2025. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central/State rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the New Labour Codes and would provide appropriate accounting effect on the basis of such developments as needed."

The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting held on 22 January 2026, approved issuance of bonus shares, in the proportion of 3:1, i.e. (3 (Three) bonus equity shares of ₹ 10 each for every 1 (One) fully paid-up equity share held as on the record date, subject to statutory and regulatory approvals as applicable as well as approval of members of the Holding Company to be obtained by way of postal ballot.

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.
6. The Group operates in one segment i.e. Information Technology services. Accordingly, no separate segment disclosures as required under "Ind AS-108: Operating Segments" have been presented.
7. "The Government of India has consolidated 29 existing labour legislations into a united framework comprising four Labour Codes viz Code on Wages, 2019, Industrial Relations Code, 2020, Code on Social Security, 2020, and Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 (collectively referred to as 'the New Labour Codes'). The New Labour Codes have been made effective from 21 November 2025. The Ministry of Labour & Employment published draft Central Rules and FAOs to enable assessment of the financial impact due to changes in regulations. Basis the Group's assessment, there is no material impact on the consolidated financial results for the quarter/period ended 31 December 2025. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central/State rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the New Labour Codes and would provide appropriate accounting effect on the basis of such developments as needed."
8. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting held on 22 January 2026, approved issuance of bonus shares, in the proportion of 3:1, i.e. (3 (Three) bonus equity shares of ₹ 10 each for every 1 (One) fully paid-up equity share held as on the record date, subject to statutory and regulatory approvals as applicable as well as approval of members of the Holding Company to be obtained by way of postal ballot.

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans. Further there are restrictions under the Shareholders' Agreement on the voting rights and transferability of shares by CPCL. Considering the terms of Shareholders' Agreement and rights available to Infobeans, the Group has recognised financial liability instead of Non-controlling interest in the consolidated financial results. During the quarter ended 31 December 2025, EIPL has entered into a land lease agreement for 50 years with MPSEDC for the Project."
3. The Board of Directors of the Holding Company at its meeting dated 02 May 2025 approved the draft scheme of amalgamation ("Scheme") of Infobeans Cloudtech Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company) with the Holding Company under sections 230 to 232 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") subject to the requisite approvals under the Act and the sanction of the scheme by National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The appointed date of the said scheme is 01 April 2025 or such other date as may be approved by the NCLT or any other competent authority. During the period ended 31 December 2025, the Holding Company has filed the Scheme with NCLT.
4. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on 15 May 2025 approved a proposal to buyback fully paid up 215,520 equity shares of the Holding Company having a face value of Rs. 10 each at a price of Rs. 464 per share, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ₹ 1,000 lakhs through tender offer process in accordance with Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy-back of Securities) Regulations, 2018 as amended. The buy-back issue opened on 02 June 2025 and closed on 06 June 2025 (both days inclusive). In accordance with relevant statutory provisions, the Holding Company has created a capital redemption reserve of Rs. 22 lakhs, equal to the nominal value of shares bought back, as an appropriation from retained earnings.
5. During the period ended 31 December 2025, 86,550 equity shares of ₹ 10/- each fully paid, were allotted upon exercise of the vested stock options pursuant to the Holding Company's Employee Stock Option Scheme, 2016 resulting in an increase in the paid-up share capital by Rs. 9 lakhs and securities premium by Rs. 277 lakhs.

**Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Results:**
1. The above results were reviewed by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on 22 January 2026 and were subjected to limited review by the Statutory Auditors.
2. "Madhya Pradesh State Electronics Development Corporation Limited ("MPSEDC") issued RFP dated 13 December 2024 for construction of Green IT Park Building in Indore, Madhya Pradesh on design, build, finance, operate, transfer (DBFOT) basis under Public Private Partnership (PPP) (the "Project"). Infobeans Technologies Limited ("Infobeans") and Capital Constructions Private Limited ("CPCL") had submitted a joint bid as a consortium and won the bid for the Project and was awarded the Project. During the quarter ended 30 September 2025, the Holding Company has incorporated a subsidiary, Ecoplex Infra Private Limited ("EIPL") for the proposed construction of IT park in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Infobeans holds 76% equity shares in EIPL and 24% equity shares are held by CPCL as per the requirement of the RFP. Infobeans will infuse funds of upto Rs. 5,000 lakhs in EIPL by way of Optionally Convertible Debentures and remaining project cost will be funded by EIPL from borrowings from banks or financial institutions which will be secured by corporate guarantee by Infobeans. Under the Shareholders' Agreement executed among EIPL, Infobeans and CPCL dated 15 October 2025 ("Shareholders' Agreement"), Infobeans has the right to appoint all the directors of EIPL and has a call option exercisable anytime to buy back equity shares held by CPCL at fair market value under the provisions of Income Tax Act or at such price at the discretion of Infobeans.
