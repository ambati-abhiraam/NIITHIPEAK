# Ratan Tata, and a romance interrupted

Carolyn Jones, whom Ratan Tata hoped to marry, before the 1962 India-China war altered their lives, passed away on January 18. Tata's biographer Thomas Mathew reflects on their quiet, graceful love story

On Sunday last, Carolyn Jones, born Carolyn Emmons, passed on in San Francisco after battling cancer. She was 83, and the wife Ratan Tata never had.

In August 1962, Ratan, 25, had returned to Mumbai to be with the ailing Lady Navajbai Tata, his adoptive grandmother and "guiding light". But he had seriously contemplated returning to Los Angeles to spend his life with Carolyn and fulfil his heart's desire to be an architect in the city famous for its welcoming weather.

Carolyn was the attractive, elegant, 19-year-old daughter of Frederick Emmons, the partner at the firm that gave Ratan his first job. Standing 165 cm tall, she sported a bouffant hairstyle, worn by the elite of the society, including Jacqueline Kennedy. It made her look taller and a match for the six-foot-plus Ratan.

I had interviewed her at her home in San Francisco for Ratan's biography. As Ratan had by then revealed how much they were in love, I took with me some specially made Kashmiri stoles as a gift to her. She accepted them with distinct grace.

It was a day-long, nothing-held-back interview, paused only when she served me the lunch she had cooked. She recalled her first meeting with Ratan and confessed that, as she peered into his hazel eyes, she kind of blanked out. It was the beginning of a rapturous and intense relationship that came tantalisingly close to marriage.

Ratan did not wait to ask a yearning Carolyn out. It was not "fancy dates", she recalled, as he neither had enough money nor a car. But that mattered little to them. She belonged to an affluent family, and the couple used her Volkswagen Karmann Ghia coupe for their dates.

Marriage was on their minds, and on Saturdays, they inspected cars with the dealers in Beverly Hills, like soon-to-be-married couples. Carolyn's favourite was the French Facel Vega, which they planned to buy to go on long drives after their marriage.

He had also become the darling of her parents. Her mother "thought it was the most wonderful thing" that could happen to Carolyn. For her parents, Ratan was already family, and they even put him in charge of their house and their pet cat when they went on holiday. It was a modern house of glass and steel, which her father's partnership firm had made famous. But it spooked Ratan, who feared ghosts, as it reflected images when the room was dimly lit. It left him scared to "death" when he went to feed the cat, recalled Carolyn.

Ratan usually spent his weekends with Carolyn, listening to songs of Edith Piaf, the French chanteuse. She added that her parents had, however, forbidden them from staying over at each other's place. But with a twinkle in her eyes, she added: "He got around things like that, you know."

When he returned to India to be with his grandmother, they decided she would soon follow.

But in October 1962, the Sino-Indian war broke out. Coming not long after the Korean War, for an American, India looked like an unsafe country. Reluctantly, a heartbroken Carolyn abandoned her plans to join Ratan.

It was a decision she would later come to rue, especially as her parents would have supported her going to India. She said, "I do regret not going. I never gave it a chance... I really wish I had."

"He was perfect. I had my whole life sort of planned. I thought it was going to be the most wonderful life."

**CAROLYN JONES CONFESSED THAT EVEN TWO DECADES AFTER THEY PARTED, WHEN SHE LEARNED THAT RATAN TATA WAS STILL A BACHELOR, IT MADE HER "INSIDES HAPPY"**

The distance drifted her apart. She ended up marrying Owen Jones, who she said "was very much like Ratan," an architect and a flier. But her father said that she married on the rebound.

Carolyn's marriage broke Ratan's heart. He was jealous and was keen to marry her if she were unhappy. Four years after he had last seen her, Ratan took her and her husband out to dinner. She was then expecting her second child. Yet she was "excited to see him," she recalled.

"You seem to be happily married, so I decided then and there never to contact you again," Carolyn quoted Ratan, who told her this several years later.

But the embers of their love defied death. She confessed that even two decades after they parted, when she learned that Ratan was still a bachelor, it made her "insides happy", though she admitted that it was a "selfish and horrible" thought to have.

Owen died at 70, in 2006. Carolyn was 66, and a grandmother. With her family settled, a chance viewing of the 2007 Hollywood comedy-drama, *The Darjeeling Limited*, triggered an avalanche of memories of Ratan. She sent him an email informing him that she wanted to meet him. Instant came the reply: "If you're coming, I'd love to see you, have dinner."

She spent nearly five weeks in India, during which they met several times. The first meeting was at Taj Mansingh in Delhi. "I was so nervous, he gave me a big hug, and it was just...", she recalled.

Since then, during his visits to the US, he invariably flew to the West Coast to spend time with her. He recalled to me: "I usually go and have dinner with her. I usually take one evening, sort of reserve, to have dinner with her."

Carolyn, on her part, visited Ratan regularly and stayed at his home, Halekai, in Colaba, Mumbai, especially on his birthdays.

When I met her, she also surprised me by handing me two of her favourite photos of Ratan that she had preserved for nearly 56 years for use in the book. She said that she had hidden them in her personal almirah.

I also kept in touch with her, and whenever I visited the US, I never forgot to bring her Kashmiri stoles, which she had become fond of.

That was, however, not my last gift to her. She asked me for two copies of the biography of Ratan that I had written, which I sent with a personal note. Her son wrote to me, saying the book "thrilled my mother and our whole family" and that "it truly captures what a remarkable man Ratan Tata was and how much he meant to a nation".

But the union that was not to be got India a business leader with few equals, and the Tata group, a chairman who made the "Tata" name more famous across the world, rekindling Indian pride by acquiring marquee symbols of western dominance.

Now that Carolyn has passed on, perhaps those who believe in the afterlife may wish that the union sought on earth would become a reality in heaven, with a waiting Ratan having made the journey first.

# Why Greenland has drawn America for over a century

From Cold War defence pacts to Trump's annexation threats, the Arctic island has often found itself at the centre to Washington's strategic calculations

MOHAMMAD ASIF KHAN
New Delhi, 23 January

United States President Donald Trump has softened his rhetoric on Greenland, toning down earlier suggestions of annexing the island by force and stepping back from threats to impose tariffs on eight European allies who opposed his stance. The shift followed a meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday.

Trump has nevertheless said a new deal related to Greenland is forthcoming and hinted at a proposed missile defence initiative known as the “Golden Dome”, which he said is linked to Greenland’s security.

While details of the agreement have not been made public, preliminary assessments suggest it could allow a greater US military presence on the island, including additional troops and installations.

*The New York Times*, citing senior US officials, reported that the framework under discussion could grant the US sovereignty over specific pockets of Greenlandic land, which would be treated as US sovereign territory. The proposal is reportedly modelled on Britain’s sovereign base areas in Cyprus.

Greenland’s PM Jens-Fredrik Nielsen and Denmark’s PM Mette Frederiksen have strongly opposed the idea, describing sovereignty as a “red line”. Trump’s repeated questioning of Greenland’s status, combined with his criticism of the costs of Nato’s collective defence, has alarmed European leaders. They fear Trump could use economic or military pressure against allies to advance strategic goals, raising concerns about Nato’s future and exposing internal fractures within the alliance. Nato’s collective defence, the bedrock of which is Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, states that an armed attack against one member is to be treated as an attack against all, demanding immediate assistance, collective or individual.

“Clearly the rules-based international order is under major stress, and Trump is a big factor in that,” Mike Albertus, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told *Business Standard*. “He is threatening traditional allies and defending the use of American force wherever he chooses.”

Albertus added: “I believe we are witnessing the end of the prior global era and the beginning of a new one — one that will be characterised more by force and the projection of military power than in recent decades.”

## The American gaze

Greenland, the world’s largest island, is a semi-autonomous territory that has been part of the Kingdom of Denmark for roughly 305 years. Its location in the Arctic gives it major geostrategic importance.

US interest in Greenland predates Trump. In the 1860s, US Secretary of State William Seward proposed purchasing Greenland from Denmark following the acquisition of Alaska from Russia in 1867. A 1868 report, which he commissioned, argued that the island was rich in fisheries and minerals. However, opposition in Congress and reluctance from Denmark halted the plan. The US later recognised Danish sovereignty over Greenland as part of the Danish West Indies (Virgin Islands) agreement.

Greenland has hosted a US military presence since the Second World War. After Nazi Germany occupied Denmark in 1940, Danish ambassador to the US, Henrik Kauffmann, is believed to have acted on his own to authorise Washington to build airstrips and ports in Greenland under a 1941 defence agreement. There is a 2020 Danish drama film on Kauffmann and the signing of the Greenland treaty, which is titled *The Good Traitor*.

Later, in 1946, the US, under President Harry S Truman, made a secret offer to buy Greenland for $100 million in gold, an offer Denmark rejected.

## Resource rich, but dependent

A 1951 US-Denmark defence agreement allowed the US to maintain military installations on the island, including what is now known as Pituffik Space Base, a key node in missile warning and space surveillance systems. The agreement remains the legal foundation for the American presence in Greenland.

Denmark’s chief negotiator later said the American draft of the pact gave the impression that Copenhagen had “practically sold Greenland to the US”. Denmark’s leverage, however, was limited by Nato’s doctrine of collective defence, which made Greenland critical to western security. Greenland was a crucial Arctic base throughout the Cold War but became less prominent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, as the Arctic ice melts, opening more shipping routes, the strategic value of Greenland becomes more important than ever.

In 2019, Trump publicly revived the idea of buying Greenland, prompting strong objections from Denmark, which views the territory as an integral part of the kingdom. The following year, the US reopened its consulate in Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, after 67 years and expanded economic aid worth $12.1 million to support key industries such as mining and tourism.

Despite its vast size, Greenland is sparsely populated and remains economically dependent on Danish subsidies and foreign investment. It also holds rare earth mineral reserves, which have drawn interest from major powers.

China offered loans to finance airport construction projects on the island, raising concerns in Europe and the US. Denmark intervened to fund two-thirds of the projects to prevent Beijing from gaining a foothold in the region. In 2019, Shenghe Resources, a Chinese state-owned company, sought access for the exploration of Greenland’s rare earth minerals, a move blocked by Denmark and the US. To counter Chinese influence, the US later acquired the Tanbreez rare earth deposit in southern Greenland. China’s foreign ministry has dismissed concerns, saying the “so-called China threat” is groundless.

While Trump’s renewed focus on Greenland has unsettled Europe, any decision on the island’s future must include the consent of Greenlanders themselves.

Polling by research agency Verian shows most Greenlanders oppose US annexation and currently favour remaining with Denmark, although many view independence as a long-term goal.

For now, the icy island remains a hotly debated territory.
