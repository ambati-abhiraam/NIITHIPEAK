# Zensar reports 25% YoY PAT growth for Q3FY26

### Statement of Consolidated Unaudited Financial Results for the Quarter and Nine Months ended December 31, 2025

₹ in Million except earnings per share

**Notes:**

1  These unaudited results have been prepared in accordance with the recognition and measurement principles laid down in the Indian Accounting Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" ("Ind AS 34"), prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with relevant rules issued there under as amended from time to time. The above financial results were reviewed and recommended by the Audit Committee and taken on record by the Board of Directors at their meeting held on January 22, 2026.

2  Standalone Financial Information:

3  The Board of Directors at its meeting held on January 22, 2026 declared an interim dividend of ₹ 2.40 per equity share of the Company for the Financial Year 2025-26. The Record Date for the aforesaid interim dividend will be January 29, 2026.

4  The above is an extract of the detailed format of Quarterly Financial Results filed with the Stock Exchanges under Regulation 33 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015. The full format of the standalone and consolidated quarterly financial results are available on stock exchange websites (www.nseindia.com and www.bseindia.com) and on Company's website (www.zensar.com).

5  The Company has also created Zensar Employees Welfare Trust (the 'ESOP Trust') for providing share-based payments, as a vehicle for distributing shares to employees under Employee Stock Option Scheme 2025. The Company has treated ESOP Trust as its extension. As at December 31, 2025, ESOP Trust has acquired 781,257 Equity shares from open market. Shares held by the ESOP Trust are treated as Treasury Shares. The paid-up Equity Share Capital has been disclosed net of Treasury Shares and while computing the basic and diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of equity shares held by trust have been reduced.

6  On November 21, 2025, the Government of India notified the four Labour Codes - the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020, and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 - consolidating 29 existing labour laws. The Group has assessed and disclosed the incremental impact of these changes on the basis of the best information available and guidance provided by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Considering the materiality and regulatory-driven, non-recurring nature of this impact, the Group has presented such incremental impact as "Statutory impact of new Labour Codes" under "Exceptional Items" in the interim consolidated statement of profit and loss for the period ended December 31, 2025. The incremental impact on provisions for employee benefits expenses of ₹ 254 Million primarily arises due to change in wage definition. The Group continues to monitor the finalisation of Central / State Rules and clarifications from the Government on other aspects of the Labour Code and would provide appropriate accounting effect as and when such clarifications are issued/rules are notified.
